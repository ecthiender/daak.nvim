daak.nvim is a simple neovim plugin to make HTTP and GraphQL requests. You don't
have to leave your editor, and you can fully edit, manipulate, inspect request
and responses. The request and response are written in plain text, and can exist
in any buffer, from where you can execute the request. This means, you can have
a collection of requests saved in a file, which you can open and start executing
requests, or you can open up a scratch buffer, type in the request and execute
it.
